Study Description: Inhibitory control over our thoughts and actions is an important predictor of later life outcomes including health, wealth, and academic performance. These developments may reflect children transitioning from primarily engaging control reactively (in-the-moment as needed) to increasingly engaging control proactively (planning ahead to engage), given the role of proactive processes in mature inhibitory control. This transition suggests that older and younger children may benefit from different forms of inhibitory control support. To test this account, we used a novel tablet-based motion tracking Go/No-go task to assess the effectiveness of in-the-moment reminders to support 3-7-year-olds’ inhibitory. Contrary to our expectations, in-the-moment reminders did not improve children’s performance on the task; however, motion tracking analyses provided deeper insight into children’s inhibitory control behaviors
